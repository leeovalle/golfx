## ✨ Overview

Golfx is a social media platform for golfers to share swings, ask questions, and connect with others. Users can authenticate pseudonymously (secret key or random user ID), create rich posts (title, text, images, video), upvote each post once, comment, sort and search feeds by time, popularity, or flags (“Question”, “Opinion”), explore trending posts, bookmark favorites, and manage their profiles. Built with React & Vite on the frontend, and Supabase for storage & authentication.
